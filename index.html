<h1>Prep - Making a Convincing Argument</h1>
<p>
My cause in the WDD server is that LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time (the GOAT). Through a mix of amazing
accomplishments and longevity, LeBron stands above all other competition and should be considered at the highest of the basketball
rankings. A common misconception that many people have pertaining to my cause is that believing that Michael Jordan is the GOAT.
There are many different factors you can look at that lead me to believe that LeBron is better than Jordan.
</p>
<p>
Consistently, LeBron does more with less and has a greater effect on the success of his team. After Jordan retired the first year,
the Chicago Bulls only won 2 less games the next season. Whenever LeBron left Cleveland the first time, they won 42 less games the next
season. LeBron led his team to more wins with a worse supporting cast around him. LeBron consistently has a major effect on his team.
While Jordan does have more championships, LeBron consistently makes deep playoff runs and has made the playoffs 14 out
of his 16 seasons. At the beginning of his career, MJ was not even making the playoffs or winning any playoff rounds.

<p>
LeBron is also a more complete player than MJ. There isn't a thing on the basketball floor that MJ does better. LeBron is a more
efficient scorer, better playmaker, better rebounder, and a more versatile defender. Jordan is a great player, but he is not the
complete player that LeBron is
</p>
<p>
What allows LeBron to win the argument as greatest of all time for me is longevity. LeBron is in his 17th season and is currently
averaging 26pts, 8rebs, and 11 assists per game. Jordan only played 15 seasons, and his last 2 seasons show significant decline,
while LeBron is putting together one of his best seasons yet and is in early contention for Most Valuable Player.
